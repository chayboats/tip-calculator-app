# Tip Calculator
![calculator](calculator.png)

The Tip Calculator is a project inspired by a prompt from Frontend Mentor. Initially created before learning JavaScript, it was designed to replicate a tip calculator's visual design and functionality.

After gaining more knowledge, I revisited the project to enhance my skills. I made the design responsive for mobile devices and started implementing the calculator's functionality through JavaScript, although it's a work in progress.

## Features

- Responsive design for mobile devices.
- Ongoing development of a working tip calculator.

2. Select the desired tip percentage.
